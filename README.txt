Contextual Contacts (renamed to Recall) is a simple app that helps you keep track of who you’ve met in the past by saving when and where you’ve met them. This app attempts to solve the problem of saving a contact in your address book only to forget their name.


KEY FEATURES
------------------------------
* Contacts are saved in your Address Book with date and location in Notes section
* Location field autocompletes nearby locations
* Contact detail views display "Send Text" and "Send Email" buttons when phone numbers or email addresses are available
* Sending Text/Email prepares a "Hi <Contact Name>, It was nice to meet you at <Location Name>" message when location is available
* If contact location is unavailable, the message is built with date instead. "Hi <Contact Name>, It was great meeting you on <Date>"


PLANNED FEATURES
------------------------------
* Calendar integration - Adds contacts to your calendar
* Full Text Search - Search your history for any combination of nearby venues, dates, and names
